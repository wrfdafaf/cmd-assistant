### WELCOME TO "CMD-Assistant"

This is a cmd assistant that you can quickly get started with. It can help you avoid the hassle of searching for various commands that you don't know. Just type what you want to do, and this assistant can help you complete it in no time.

This assistant is currently only applicable to Windows systems.

### HOW TO USE
It only takes you two steps.
###### step 1: Download and activate a large language model
- We are using an open-source large model called llama that can run locally.
- To download it, you need to first visit the Ollama official website(https://ollama.com/).
- Download llama 3.1 to your computer, ensuring that you save it in a separate folder.
- Open the directory where you downloaded LLaMA 3.1, type "cmd" in the address bar to enter the command prompt, and then type "ollama serve". Once completed, you can proceed to the next step.
###### step 2: Start Using
- Open cmd and type "python CMD-assistant.py". (Note! You must open cmd in the directory where you want to perform the operation to ensure that the assistant can execute the action you want to perform)
